Changing XSIZE & YSIZE to e.g. 100 (and forest/city/village count the same) makes a small map with
a lot of forests in the background, cities and villages on top of that and each other, and the
effect (with a little imagination) is a quite realistic looking world map! Like a map of an entire
world/continent. This could/should be used/exploited for something!
