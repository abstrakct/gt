v0.0.10: (2010-03-12)
We now have ALIVE monsters! The default AI is "choose random direction;
walk there". The first 3 monsters are "a kitty cat", "a grinning idiot" and "a
zombie jesus".

v0.0.11: (2010-03-23)
* Slightly more intelligent AI
* GOLD! And, you can pick it up!
* A lot of new items! (But they still do nothing!)
* Speed! Monsters (and theoretically the player) now move at different speeds.
* UI tweaks!
* You can wield items! Not that it does any difference yet, but still!


	-- An example: The Silent Creeper now seeks out the player (but the
			player can outrun him! At least until speed affecting
			items/spells are added...)
