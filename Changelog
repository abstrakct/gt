v0.0.10: (2010-03-12)
We now have ALIVE monsters! The default AI is "choose random direction;
walk there". The first 3 monsters are "a kitty cat", "a grinning idiot" and "a
zombie jesus".

v0.0.11: (2010-03-23)
* Slightly more intelligent AI
* GOLD! And, you can pick it up!
* A lot of new items! (But they still do nothing!)
* Speed! Monsters (and theoretically the player) now move at different speeds.
* UI tweaks!
* You can wield items! Not that it does any difference yet, but still!


	-- An example: The Silent Creeper now seeks out the player (but the
			player can outrun him! At least until speed affecting
			items/spells are added...)

v0.0.11.1: (2010-03-28)
* Hardcoded attacking/killing of monsters! You only do 1 point of damage right
now, and the monster doesn't fight back.

v0.0.11.2: (2010-03-29)
* Monster now fights back after being attacked. Stupidly simple, but still, a
a start.

2010-03-30: Optimized the cell_t structure! Now we use considerably less
memory!

v0.0.12: (2010-04-01)
* Inventory now works great for both player & cells, as well as multiple items
on a cell!
* Wands and rings get assigned a random material, so e.g. all wands of fire
become "an iron wand" when unidentified.
TODO: make identification work on a type of item, not just a single item!
(so if you have identifed "iron wand" to be a wand of fire, that should work
 for all iron wands.)

v0.0.13: (2010-04-01)
* More advanced attack system!
* Weapons do different damage!
* Armor can be worn!
	- on body, head, gloves & feet! (and too-tight-shoes-joke!)
* AC has an effect!
* We have gloves, footwear, headwear, shields and a whole lotta armor! (Thanks AD&D!)
* Knowledge & intelligence now decides your worldview.
* -- And it changes, primitively, based on your success in this life.
* Monsters now chase the player, after being attacked. Unless the player outrun them,
	of course!
